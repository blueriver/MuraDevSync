This is a proof of concept plugin designed to allow devlopers to link installed plugins and themes to external directories.  Each time Mura reloads it copies the latest code from the external directories.</p>
The mappings are configured in the sync.xml at the root of the plugin.

<DevSync>
<plugins>
<plugin package="example" external="/complete/path/to/external/directory"/>
</plugins>
<directories>
<diretory internal="/includes/default/themes/merced" external="/complete/path/to/external/directory"/>
</directories>
</DevSync>
